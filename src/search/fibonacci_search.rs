/// Uses the lower of a fibonacci triple (eg. 3, 5, and 8) as the middle point in a binary search.
/// In practice fibonacci Search search is rarely faster than a binary search.
///
/// Reasons that I have seen for using fibonacci search:
///
/// 1. Fibonacci Search divides given array in unequal parts
/// 2. Binary Search uses division operator to divide range. Fibonacci Search doesnâ€™t use /, but
///    uses + and -. The division operator may be costly on some CPUs.
/// 3. Fibonacci Search examines relatively closer elements in subsequent steps. So when input
///    array is so big that it cannot fit in CPU cache or even in RAM, Fibonacci Search can be
///    useful.
///
